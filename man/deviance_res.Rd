\title{Calculate deviance residuals for binomial models}
\usage{
deviance_res(y, pred_probs)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A numeric vector of true binary outcomes (0 or 1).}

\item{pred_probs}{A numeric vector of predicted probabilities (values
between 0 and 1) from the model.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of deviance residuals, with one value for each
  observation.
}
\description{
This function computes the deviance residuals, a measure of lack of fit for
each observation in a binomial (e.g., logistic regression) model.
}
\details{
The deviance residual for each observation is calculated using the formula:
\deqn{
  r_{i} = -2 * (y_i * \log(\hat{p}_i) + (1 - y_i) * \log(1 - \hat{p}_i))
}
where \eqn{y_i} is the true outcome and \eqn{\hat{p}_i} is the predicted
probability. A small value for the residual indicates a good fit for that
observation. The function takes the square root of the expression to align
with the standard definition of a deviance residual.

This function includes a small safeguard to handle cases where predicted
probabilities are exactly 0 or 1, preventing errors with `log(0)`.

\examples{
# Example with some true outcomes and predicted probabilities
true_y <- c(1, 0, 1, 1, 0)
pred_p <- c(0.9, 0.1, 0.6, 0.8, 0.4)
deviance_res(true_y, pred_p)

# Example with perfect prediction for one observation
perfect_pred <- c(1, 0, 1, 1, 0)
pred_p_perfect <- c(1, 0.1, 0.6, 0.8, 0.4)
deviance_res(true_y, pred_p_perfect)
